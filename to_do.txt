Nondimensional Plots (also against BEM):
1. spanwise alpha
2. spanwise phi
3. spanwise gamma
4. spanwise a and ap
5. spanwise Fax and Faz
6. CT and CQ and CP vs lambda (tip speed ratio)

Plots for sensitivity
1. Uwake
2. constant vs cosine spacing
3. nr of blade elements
4. dtheta increments
5. wakelength (also how many iterations it takes)
